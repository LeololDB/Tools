# Setup Linux environment 
## Why
**Do not run the script, PyPy is not stable enough.**
This is intended for a Graphical Linux-like OS. *(This has currently been tested on Linux Mint)*
It is made so if you often create new Linux VMs or just has to do a simple setup of a Linux machine.
## Setup script
This script disables anti-aliasing, install PyPy and symlink PyPy as python3.
## Default script
The Default script reverts any change to default values, including uninstalling PyPy.
## Issue
Some applications may fail working.  
Because this script is depending on PyPy replacing Python, PyPy should not glitch, but it does.  
I suggest changing PyPy by a better alternative.
