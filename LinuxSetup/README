# Setup Linux environment 
This is intended for a Graphical Linux-like OS, this has currently been tested on Linux Mint.

The Setup script is made so if you often create new Linux VMs or just has to setup correctly a Linux machine.  
This script disables anti-aliasing, install PyPy and symlink PyPy as python3.
The Default script reverts everything to default values, including uninstalling PyPy.
